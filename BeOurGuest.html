<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">LUMIERE: Be our guest. Be our guest.
Put our service to the test.
Tie a napkin ‘round your neck, cherie,
And we’ll provide the rest.
Soup du jour, hot hors d’oeuvres - 
Why we only live live to serve!
Try the grey stuff. It’s delicious.
Don’t believe me? Ask the dishes.
They can sing. They can dance.
After all, miss, this is France!
And a dinner here is never second best.
Go on, unfold your menu.
Take a glance and then
You’ll be out guest, Oui, our guest.
Be our guest.

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">ALL: Beef ragout. Cheese souffle.
Pie and pudding “en flambe.”

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">LUMIERE: We’ll prepare and
Serve with flair a culinary cabaret!
You’re alone and you’re scared,
But the banquet’s all prepared.
No one’s gloomy or complaining
While the flatware’s entertaining.
We tell jokes, I do tricks
With my fellow candlesticks.

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">ALL: And that’s all in perfect taste,
That you can bet.
Come on and lift your glass.
You’ve won your own free pass
To be our guest!

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">LUMIERE: If you’re stressed, it’s fine dining we 
suggest. 

 <p><span style="font-weight:bold;">ALL: Be our guest! Be our guest! Be our
guest! 

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">MRS. POTTS: It’s a guest! It’s a guest! Sake’s
alive! Well, I’ll be blessed!
Wine’s been poured and, thank the Lord,
I’ve had the napkins freshly pressed.
With dessert, she’ll want tea
And, my dear, that’s fine with me.
While the cups do their soft-shoeing,
I’ll be bubbling, I’ll be brewing.
I’ll get warm, piping hot.
Heaven’s sake!
Is that a spot? Clean it up!
We want the company impressed.
We’ve got a lot to do…
Is it one lump or two for you, our guest?

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">ALL: She’s our guest!

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">MRS. POTTS: She’s our guest!

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">ALL: She’s our guest!
Be our guest! Be our guest! Be our guest!

Be our guest! Be our guest!
Our command is your request.
It’s been years since
We’ve had anybody here
(spoken) And we’re obsessed!
With your meal, with your ease.
Yes, indeed, we aim to please.
While the candlelights still glowing,
Let us help you.
We’ll keep going…
Course...by...course
One by one
‘Till you shout:
(spoken) “Enough I’m done!”
Then, we’ll sing you off to sleep as you digest.
Tonight you’ll prop your feet,
But for now, let’s eat up.
Be our guest…
Be our guest…
Be our best.
Please...be...our...guest!LUMIERE: Be our guest. Be our guest.
