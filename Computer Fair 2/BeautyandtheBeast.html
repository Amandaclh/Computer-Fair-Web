			<span style="font-weight:bold;">MRS.POTTS:</span> Tale as old as time, true as it can be.</br>
			Barely even friends,</br>
			Then somebody bends, unexpectedly,</br>
			Just a little change, small to say the least.</br>
			Both a little scared, neither one prepared,</br>
			Beauty and the Beast.</br>
			Ever just the same, ever a surprise.</br>
			Ever as before, ever just as sure as the sun will rise.</br>
			Tale as old as time, tune as old as song.</br>
			Bittersweet and strange, finding you can change,</br>
			learning you were wrong.</br>
			Certain as the sun rising in the east,</br>
			Tale as old as time, song as old as rhyme,</br>
			Beauty and the Beast.</br>
			Tale as old as time, song as old as rhyme,v
			Beauty and...the Beast.</br>
