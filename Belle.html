			<p><span style="font-weight:bold;"> BELLE:</span> Little town, it's a quiet village. 
Every day like the one before. 
Little town full of little people waking up to say…</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">8TH GRADE:</span> Bonjour! Bonjour! Bonjour! Bonjour! Bonjour!</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">BELLE:</span> There goes the baker with his tray like always,
The same old bread and rolls to sell. 
Every morning just same,
Since the morning that we came
To this poor provincial town.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">BELLE & BAKER</span> speak.
(<span style="font-weight:bold;">BAKER:</span> Marie, the baguettes! Hurry up!</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">CHORUS:</span> Look, here she goes,
The girl is strange, no question. 
Dazed and distracted, can’t you tell?
Never part of any crowd 'Cause her head's up on some cloud. 
No denying she’s a funny girl, that Belle.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">CHORUS (GRADES 3,5,7):</span> Bonjour!</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">CHORUS (GRADES 2,4,6):</span> Good day!</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">CHORUS (GRADES 3,5,7):</span> How is your family?</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">CHORUS (GRADES 2,4,6):</span> Bonjour. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">CHORUS (GRADES 3,5,7):</span> Good day!</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">CHORUS (GRADES 2,4,6):</span> How is your wife?</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">8TH GRADE:</span> I need...six eggs! That's too expensive!</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">BELLE:</span> There must be more than this provincial life!</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">BOOKSELLER & BELLE</span> talk. 
(BELLE: Thank you very much!)</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">CHORUS:</span> Look, there she goes. 
The girl is so peculiar. 
I wonder if she's feeling well. 
With a dreamy, far-off look
And her nose stuck in a book,
What a puzzle to the rest of us is Belle.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">BELLE:</span> Oh, isn't this amazing?
It's my favorite part because - you'll see...
Here's where she meets Prince Charming,
But she won't discover that it's him 'till Chapter 3.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">CHORUS:</span> Now it's no wonder that her name means
"beauty". Her looks have got no parallel.
But behind that fair facade,
I'm afraid she's rather odd. 
Very different from the rest of us is Belle.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">LEFOU & GASTON</span> speak. 
(<span style="font-weight:bold;">LEFOU:</span> Well, of course you do!)</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">GASTON:</span> Right from the moment when I met her, saw
 her, I said she’s gorgeous and I fell.
Here in town, there's only she who is as beautiful as me,
So I’m making plans to woo and marry Belle.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">SILLY GIRLS:</span> Look, there he goes! Isn’t he dreamy?
Monsieur Gaston! Oh he’s so cute!
Be still my heart! I’m hardly breathing!
He’s such a tall, dark, strong, and handsome brute!</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">CHORUS:</span> Bonjour! Good day. You call this bacon?
Some cheese! One pound. I’ll get the knife.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">CHORUS (GIRLS):</span> This bread - it's stale!</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">CHORUS (BOYS):</span> Madame’s mistaken!</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">BELLE:</span> There must be more than this provincial life!</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">GASTON:</span> Just watch, I’m going to make Belle my wife!</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">CHORUS:</span> Look, there she goes, 
A girl who’s strange by special. 
A most peculiar mademoiselle. 
It’s a pity and a sin - she doesn't quite fit in. 
‘Cause she really is a funny girl,
A beauty, but it a funny girl,
She really is a funny girl,
That Belle!
